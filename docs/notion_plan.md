# Notion Integration Plan

This document outlines initial steps for connecting the data pool project with Notion.

## Goals
- Track tasks and design notes in a centralized workspace.
- Eventually push cleaned datasets to a Notion database for review.

## Proposed Steps
1. Set up a Notion workspace and create a database for project tasks.
2. Generate an integration token and share the database with it.
3. Implement a `NotionClient` in `data_pool/notion.py` to communicate with the API.
4. Use `urllib.request` for HTTP operations to avoid external dependencies.
5. Add unit tests with mocks to validate request payloads without requiring network access.

Further details will be fleshed out as development progresses.
